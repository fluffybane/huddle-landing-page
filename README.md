## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is difficult to come back to a project you started a while ago and recall the thought process you were having. 90% of the work on this challenge was done several months ago. 10% was cleanup and optimisation before submission.

### Continued development

I did not have time to add the interactive elements (hover styles) to the design.
